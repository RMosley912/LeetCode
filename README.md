## 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
Easy

Companies
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.
Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:
```
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
``` 


Constraints:

```
1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-100 <= nums[i] <= 100
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
```


## 2799. Count Complete Subarrays in an Array
Medium

Companies
You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers.

We call a subarray of an array complete if the following condition is satisfied:

The number of distinct elements in the subarray is equal to the number of distinct elements in the whole array.
Return the number of complete subarrays.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty part of an array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The complete subarrays are the following: [1,3,1,2], [1,3,1,2,2], [3,1,2] and [3,1,2,2].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,5,5,5]
Output: 10
Explanation: The array consists only of the integer 5, so any subarray is complete. The number of subarrays that we can choose is 10.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
1 <= nums[i] <= 2000
