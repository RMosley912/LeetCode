## 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
Easy

Companies
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.
Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:
```
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
``` 


Constraints:

```
1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-100 <= nums[i] <= 100
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
```

### Answer
```
var removeDuplicates = function(nums) {
let index = 1
for (let i = 0; i < nums.length -1; i++){
    if nums [i] != nums [i +1] {
    index +++
      } 
     }
 };
```

## 2799. Count Complete Subarrays in an Array
Medium
374
9
Companies
You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers.

We call a subarray of an array complete if the following condition is satisfied:

The number of distinct elements in the subarray is equal to the number of distinct elements in the whole array.
Return the number of complete subarrays.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty part of an array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The complete subarrays are the following: [1,3,1,2], [1,3,1,2,2], [3,1,2] and [3,1,2,2].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,5,5,5]
Output: 10
Explanation: The array consists only of the integer 5, so any subarray is complete. The number of subarrays that we can choose is 10.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
1 <= nums[i] <= 2000


## 2634. Filter Elements from Array
Easy
416
28
Companies
Given an integer array arr and a filtering function fn, return a filtered array filteredArr.

The fn function takes one or two arguments:

arr[i] - number from the arr
i - index of arr[i]
filteredArr should only contain the elements from the arr for which the expression fn(arr[i], i) evaluates to a truthy value. A truthy value is a value where Boolean(value) returns true.

Please solve it without the built-in Array.filter method.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [0,10,20,30], fn = function greaterThan10(n) { return n > 10; }
Output: [20,30]
Explanation:
const newArray = filter(arr, fn); // [20, 30]
The function filters out values that are not greater than 10
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2,3], fn = function firstIndex(n, i) { return i === 0; }
Output: [1]
Explanation:
fn can also accept the index of each element
In this case, the function removes elements not at index 0
Example 3:

Input: arr = [-2,-1,0,1,2], fn = function plusOne(n) { return n + 1 }
Output: [-2,0,1,2]
Explanation:
Falsey values such as 0 should be filtered out

## 2677. Chunk Array
Easy
231
3
Companies
Given an array arr and a chunk size size, return a chunked array. A chunked array contains the original elements in arr, but consists of subarrays each of length size. The length of the last subarray may be less than size if arr.length is not evenly divisible by size.

You may assume the array is the output of JSON.parse. In other words, it is valid JSON.

Please solve it without using lodash's _.chunk function.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], size = 1
Output: [[1],[2],[3],[4],[5]]
Explanation: The arr has been split into subarrays each with 1 element.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,9,6,3,2], size = 3
Output: [[1,9,6],[3,2]]
Explanation: The arr has been split into subarrays with 3 elements. However, only two elements are left for the 2nd subarray.
Example 3:

Input: arr = [8,5,3,2,6], size = 6
Output: [[8,5,3,2,6]]
Explanation: Size is greater than arr.length thus all elements are in the first subarray.
Example 4:

Input: arr = [], size = 1
Output: []
Explanation: There are no elements to be chunked so an empty array is returned.
 

Constraints:

arr is a valid JSON array
2 <= JSON.stringify(arr).length <= 105
1 <= size <= arr.length + 1

 

Constraints:

0 <= arr.length <= 1000
-109 <= arr[i] <= 109
